# 🧠 JavaScript Practice: Functions & Unit Tests

This repository contains a collection of small, commonly used JavaScript functions — each written from scratch and accompanied by detailed unit tests using **Jest**.

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this project is to strengthen core JavaScript skills by practicing:

- Writing **clean and readable functions**
- Implementing **manual logic without built-in shortcuts**
- Handling **input validation** and **errors**
- Using **JSDoc** for documenting functions
- Writing thorough **unit tests** with edge cases
- Building confidence in **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

## 🧪 What's Included

Each task includes:

- A function file (e.g., `getMostFrequentChar.js`)
- A corresponding test file (e.g., `getMostFrequentChar.test.js`)
- JSDoc-style comments describing the function's purpose, parameters, and return value

## 🛠️ Technologies

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Jest for testing

## ✅ Example Tasks

- Get the most frequent character in a string
- Check if two strings are anagrams
- Return the first unique character
- Sum numbers between two integers
- And more...

## 📦 How to Run Tests

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```
